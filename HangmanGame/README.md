I have spend 8 hours (include cofee brakes, lunch and dinner) to write this code, but I think
there need litle more time to improve arhitecture (provide MVC, IoC and tune performance) and
made some code refactoring.

Also, There are attached two another test projects where a had
much mo time to resolv it.
